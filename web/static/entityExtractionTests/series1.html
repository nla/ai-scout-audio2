      <LI>Simplified instructions; removed duplication within instructions.</LI>
      <LI>Removed uppercase instructions (but keep in entity/relationship examples).</LI>
      <LI>Allowed flexibility in naming of entities and relationships.  This may be controversial, but the 
        intent here is to allow the LLM to find the best names for these, and to refine/group/organise 
        them later using another LLM stage, given the context extracted as the "reason" value for each 
        entity and relationship, and some target knowledge graph (wikidata?).  It is likely that 
        entity and relationship names will <i>themselves</i> form part of a knowledge graph, for example, 
        "married to" and "cousin of" are subsets of "personally related to"; "worked at (some organisation)", "attended (a church or school)", "member of (some political organisation)", "member of (some artistic movement)" are subsets of (perhaps) "part of".

  <PRE>
Your task is to extract significant entities and their relationships from the provided text.

Entity Types:

Identify core entity types like PERSON, ORGANIZATION, PLACE, EVENT.
For novel entities, classify them based on semantic similarity to existing types or create new types as needed.

Relationships:

Identify relationships between entities based on semantic similarity, temporal proximity, or syntactic cues.
Common relationship types include: VISITED, ATTENDED, CREATED, IS_A, PART_OF, HAS_PROPERTY, OCCURS_AT, INVOLVES.

You should be flexible in identifying new relationship types as needed.

Please output the results in JSON format as lists of entities and relationships.  Each entity should show the 
entity name as found in the text, the type of entity and the reason you have extracted it.  Each relationship
should show the name and type of two entities in the relationship, the name and type of the relationship, and
the reason you have extracted it, supported by a snippet of text.

As an example, given this text:

### John Smith woke up startled. He'd only been in Burnley for 5 days visting his sister, Fiona, but already
he was full of anticipation for the derby between Burnley Football Club and Blackburn Rovers later that day.
He wasted no time, jumped out of bed, fed his hungry looking dog, Molly, and headed down to Turf Moor, the 
home of Burnley Football Club. ###

You should response with the following JSON:

  <TD  width="20%">
    Canberra is a city that was famously designed from the ground up. But did it really need a bespoke public transport payment system? Bus and tram users are now scratching their heads as they try and fail and try again to scan their new cards or QR codes on their phones. As glitch after glitch was reported throughout Wednesday, it was clear the system was nowhere near ready to roll out. Cards, when available, were unable to be scanned. The QR code on the MyWay+ app didn't work, with validators on buses failing to activate at stops. There's also the fact that thousands of transport users have found it near impossible to transfer remaining balances on older cards onto new ones. All of us, meanwhile, have cause to wonder how cities from Istanbul to Tokyo, London to Sydney, seem to have installed perfectly serviceable systems that make using public transport as intuitive as, well, paying for something using a phone or a card. Welcome to Canberra, the country's most progressive and highly educated jurisdiction. It may feel out of the way, but you don't have to go far up the road to locate a tried and tested system that's perfectly under control and ready to use. Why, then, didn't the ACT government opt for something already proven? This is, after all, the same government that has already copped to wasting eye-watering sums on failed IT systems and consulting contracts, and blown out the budget on a digital health record. The roll-out of a new MyWay+ system could easily have been the perfect opportunity to resolve many of the issues with the current public transport payment system in the most efficient way possible. After all, Canberra has long been a problem child when it comes to public transport and modern living. We love our Teslas, and are proud of the government's commitment to environmental sustainability. And the public transport thing is akin to the growing pains of a teenager. We're the little city that could, and we'll get there one day. But the "big country town" moniker has long been both self-determinative and largely incorrect in many respects - visitors are often pleasantly surprised by the quality of, for example, our hospitality sector. Fixing the public transport for a city of less than half a million should be a reasonably easy win, and a priority for a community so well-versed in environmental progressiveness. At this rate, we will have banned gas and wood fires before we have a fully functioning public transport system. Decrying the epic stuff-up on Thursday, Opposition Leader Leanne Castley was pleasingly succinct. "MyWay+ has cost the community $70 million, but it is not working and we don't know when, or if, it will be working as intended," she said, calling for an inquiry. Transport Canberra deputy director Ben McHugh responded that an inquiry would be welcome as everything, from procurement onwards, had been done by the book. Which book, though? The one with so many black marks, torn pages, scribbled-out policies and illegible passages drafted so long ago no one can even remember who wrote them and why? It could well be time to throw that book out and start again.

  <TD>2. <a href='https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-30/zelenskyy-suggests-ukraine-would-cede-russia-territory-for-nato/104668082'>ABC News 30Nov24</a></TD>
  <TD>
    Volodymyr Zelenskyy has suggested for the first time he would be willing to give up Ukrainian territory to Russia in exchange for NATO membership — a deal he says would end the "hot phase" of the 33-month-old war.

The Ukrainian president told UK-based Sky News the NATO membership invitation would have to be officially extended to the entire country as Ukraine had no legal right to recognise any of its territory as Russian.

However, he said the NATO membership could then initially apply to only the part of Ukraine that Kyiv controlled.


He told the program a ceasefire was needed to "guarantee that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin will not come back" to take more Ukrainian territory.

"No-one has offered us to be in NATO for one part or another part of Ukraine," he said.

"The fact is, it is a solution to stop the hot stage of the war because we can just give NATO membership to the part of Ukraine that is under our control.

"But the invitation must be given to Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders … That's what we need to do fast and then Ukraine can get back the other part of its territory diplomatically."

Mr Zelenskyy had previously maintained that Ukraine would not cede any parts of the territory to Russia, including the annexed region of Crimea which Russia claimed in 2014.


Renewed push to join alliance
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha has urged his NATO counterparts to issue an invitation to Kyiv to join the Western military alliance during a meeting in Brussels next week, according to the text of a letter seen by Reuters.

The letter reflects Ukraine's renewed push to secure an invitation to join NATO, which is part of a "victory plan" Mr Zelenskyy outlined last month.

Ukraine says it accepts that it cannot join the alliance until the war is over but extending an invitation now would show Russian President Vladimir Putin that he could not achieve one of his main goals — preventing Kyiv from becoming a NATO member.

"The invitation should not be seen as an escalation," Mr Sybiha wrote in the letter.

"On the contrary, with a clear understanding that Ukraine's membership in NATO is inevitable, Russia will lose one of its main arguments for continuing this unjustified war," he wrote.

"I urge you to endorse the decision to invite Ukraine to join the Alliance as one of the outcomes of the NATO Foreign Ministerial Meeting on 3-4 December 2024."

No NATO consensus
NATO diplomats say there is no consensus among alliance members to invite Ukraine at this stage. Any such decision would require the consent of all 32 NATO member countries.

NATO has declared that Ukraine will join the alliance and that it is on an "irreversible" path to membership. But it has not issued a formal invitation or set out a timeline.

Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's deputy prime minister in charge of NATO affairs, said Kyiv understood that the consensus for an invitation to join NATO was "not yet there" but the letter was meant to send a strong political signal.


"We have sent a message to the allies that invitation is not off the table regardless of different manipulations and speculations around that," she told Reuters.

In his letter, Mr Sybiha argued an invitation would be the right response "to Russia's constant escalation of the war it has unleashed, the latest demonstration of which is the involvement of tens of thousands of North Korean troops and the use of Ukraine as a testing ground for new weapons".

In recent days, however, diplomats have said they do not see any changes of stance among NATO countries, particularly as they await the Ukraine policy of the United States — the alliance's dominant power — under the incoming administration of president-elect Donald Trump.

Russia drones attack Kyiv, Odessa

Meanwhile, overnight, Russian drone attacks on Ukraine injured at least eight people and damaged residential buildings in Kyiv and in the southern Odesa region.

Ukraine's air force said in a statement that, of 132 drones launched against the country overnight, it downed 88, while 41 were "lost", likely due to electronic warfare, and one returned to Russian territory.

Russia has stepped up its nightly drone attacks on Ukrainian cities during its push along the eastern front line, making some of its largest monthly territorial gains since 2022.

It launched a record-high number of 188 drones against the country on Tuesday before staging a large-scale attack on Ukraine's power grid on Thursday.

The drone attack on the southern region of Odesa damaged 13 residential buildings and injured seven people, the national police said in a statement.

Fragments from downed Russian drones struck buildings in two Kyiv districts and injured one person late on Thursday, officials said.

Emergency services, in a post on the Telegram messaging app, showed pictures of rubble strewn about inside and outside a paediatric clinic in Kyiv's Dniprovskyi district on the east bank of the Dnipro River.

A security guard at the facility was taken to hospital. Adjacent buildings also suffered damage.

Mayor Vitali Klitschko said drone fragments struck an infrastructure site in the Sviatoshynskyi district on the west bank of the river.

Kyiv Regional Governor Ruslan Kravchenko reported minor damage to a private residence and another building without any casualties.

    CRIMEA CRISIS Day after day, Moscow Radio tells that the crisis of war in the Crimea is 1 still acute. And how sharply, we — in Australia particularly — need to realise. Germany, is climbing over Rostov, at the head of the Sea of Azov, and battering Kerch, on the narrow straits of Black and Azov seas. . Across Black Sea waters south-east, and along Black Sea littoral eastward, the invaders go into Russian Caucasia and Transcaucasia, on both sides of the giant mountain range. Baku and its pipe lines, in all their reticulations, are under the enemy threat. These are Russian life-lines at which Hitler has aimed during five months. Here, also, is the region in which a British front, and Australia's far-off oversea front, are to support the Soviet. Railways and roads are pushed north ward from Iran. Locomotives, trucks, and lorries are leaving the tracks of N.S5.W. to help conduct that defence. Joined with Britain, we are racing against Hitler towards the bastion of defence which Russians and British together mean to erect. Either Hitler can beat the clock, or we can; and Hitler so far is ahead; Busily preparing, the commanders of British and Australian defence go hither and thither. Wavell has been in Singapore; Auchinleck in Cairo; Blarney in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. But Hitler is at Rostov and Kerch, stretching the Nazi talons over Caucasia and Transcaucasia. He's there with his Panzer armies. Where are ours? Those things make the essential truth of the Crimean Crisis which Moscow recapitulates one day after another. If the Germans are 'not held at the Caucasus, it will be only a matter of weeks before their spearheads are on the shores of the Indian Ocean. We shall" not doubt the final power of Democracies and Soviet to gain victory against the Nazis. But it is vitally necessary that the Germans be held up at the Straits of Kerch, long enough for the Allied line of Caucasus defences to be made impregnable. Nowhere in the world today are our forces needed more urgently than in the Eastern Crimea. Every possible fighter and bomber should be put into action to keep the Germans from crossing the five or six mile stretch of water that at present separates them from the high road to India.

    CROYDON RAILWAY ACCIDENT. The accident which took place at Croydon railway station on Sunday morning, when an electric train, which was out of control, crashed into a stationary electric train, at a siding, is the most alarming accident that has occurred In Victoria since the suburban lines were electrified. Fortunately there was no loss of life. There were no passengers on board either train, and the motor- man and guard on the runaway train escaped serious injury. The motor- man jumped from his cabin before the train crashed into the stationary train, and the guard, who was in the rear compartment endeavouring to check the speed of the train, with the hand brake, suffered only from shock. A motorman who was on the stationary train was not injured in any way. There is a feeling of deep satisfaction at these facts, when contemplating the appalling possibili- ties of such an accident had each train, or even only one of them, been full of passengers. The most disturbing factor in this accident is that its cause is a mystery. And while its cause remains unexplained the possibility of another accident of a similar kind, but dreadful, even horrible in its results to human life, will haunt the minds of scores of thousands of people who are daily or frequent passengers on the electric trains. The vivid description of the accident and the effects on the fore- most carriages of the two trains, which was published in our columns yesterday, together with photographs of the damaged rolling stock, render it unnecessary to call on the imagi- nation to visualise the scene. But the imagination recoils in horror from picturing the scene had these trains been full of passengers- human bodies crushed and mangled amid the debris of the wrecked carriages, the cries of the dying and the screams of those entrapped in the wreckage as the flames from the burning debris reached them. Although the cause of the accident is wrapped in mystery, it is ap- parent that all the precautions and mechanical devices for controlling the electric trains failed to act. The runaway train had been padlocked at Ringwood since Saturday night, and was being brought to Croydon to run to the city as the first train of the day from that station. It came down the decline outside Croy- don at a speed which rapidly in- creased, and instead of responding to the brakes it dashed at a rate of over fifty miles an hour past the station platform and on to the siding, where it crashed into the empty stationary train. A special board of inquiry, consisting of three experts in the railway department, has been appointed to investigate the accident and ascertain its cause. The public will await with some anxiety the report of this board. The inquiry must be painstaking and thorough, and must arrive at the exact cause of the accident. And, in view of the state of public anxiety and alarm, the report must be made public with a minimum of delay. The possibilities which this accident envisage are so grave, so appalling, that the public must be taken fully into the confidence of the board and the railway department in regard to it. A report merely of a reassuring nature, that is obviously intended to calm public anxiety, may have the opposite effect. It will be gratifying if the report is reassuring to the extent of showing that measures will be immediately adopted to prevent the posslbillty of a similar accident. But the public will judge the report by its thoroughness, its candour and its determination to make perfectly clear where the blame lies. It may be that the accident was due to mechanical failure or to human failure. The public does not want a scapegoat; but it wants to know the exact cause of the accident, so that it may judge for itself whether travelling by electric trains is as safe as it was hitherto believed to be.

Disruption: hierarchy split on its tactics JHE current struggle be tween the two groups of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, that led by Cardinal Gilroy in NSW, and that by Archbishop Mannix and his lieuten- ant in Victoria, Santa- maria, has once more blazed out in the open. With a view to defeating the ALP candidate in the Bendigo by- election, doubtlessly, Dr. Mannix has, in effect, called the ALP a Communist Party and, on this false basis, has stated that Catholics therefore cannot vote for this party. This is intended to marshal the Catholic vote behind the reaction ary so-called Democratic Labor Party which, in turn, having no hope of winning the election, will channel its vote to the Liberals, In this way attempting the defeat of the Labor candidate. This has happened in all recent elections, thereby keeping in office the anti-working class Menzies government of the monopolies. '"pHE assertion by Dr. Mannix that the ALP is "communistic" is sheer nonsense. In that case, there would be no' need for a separate and independ ent Marxist- Leninist party, our Communist Party, in this country. The ALP leadership is now, and has always been, opposed to Marx ism, that is, the socialist revolu tion. That is why the most class conscious section of the Australian working class has created and sup ported the Communist Party. The ALP is now, and has always been, as far as its leadership is concerned, as Lenin pointed out as long ago as 1913, a liberal party while the so-called "liberals" are, in reality, Tories. Not one of the numerous Labor Party governments that have held office in this country have ever made even the slightest move in the direction of socialism; far from that, the ALP leaders sup port the SEATO aggressive mili tary alliance aimed at the coun tries where socialism is a fact of life. It is also true that the ALP platform contains the socialisation objective, which has just been re affirmed by Mr. Calwell. However, Mr. Chamberlain, the Federal President, has stated that the ALP must keep up a working class appearance; if it. moved too openly to the right, as the DLP demands of it, this would create "a void which the Communist Party would fill." JT boils down to the fact that the vague phrases used by ALP leaders about so-callea "democratic . socialism" are nothing more than a protective armour agaiiist the advance of the Comumnist Party and the militant section of the working class. That the ALP is "red" is absurd. The ALP puts forward a number of reforms of capitalism, of a similar type to those advanced by the Communist Party, demands on behalf of the trade unions and so on, and here there, car. be a co-operation between our two par ties in order to improve living standards and defend peace and broaden democracy and avoid splitting the working class. The reality in a number 0f trade unions is that the workers give support to those whom thev consider the best fighters f0r trade union policy, whether they are ALP or CP and so there are execu tives composed of leaders of both parties, the so-called "unity tickets" with which the DLP and reaction try to frighten the people. _ Tk® urnty of the working class is its most precious possession, its sharpest weapon in its struggle against monopoly. Such is the actual reality in the labour move ment which stirs up the hatred of all reactionaries, including Roman Catholic hierarchs. \ynAT Is the meaning of the conflict within the top echelon of the Catholic Church? It is around the best tactics to be adopted by that Church to prevent the further development of the labour movement and socialism, to split the workers, to bend the Labor Party to its will and obtain a number of concessions from labor govern ments, such as financial aid for its denominational schools and other institutions, as its more immediate aim. Everywhere it is powerful, the Roman Catholic hierarchy is a strong pillar of capitalism and a mortal enemy of socialism. The faction led by Cardinal Gilroy adopts the policy of work ing within the ALP in order to achieve these aims, while Dr. Mannix and Saritamaria are the spiritual fathers, of the semi-: fascist DLP, which endeavours to build up a separate anti-working class party. Both are thus a menace to the unity of the working class and its advance towards socialism. Both . must : be repudiated by the labour movement, including the Catholic workers. The interests of the Catholic workers aire the same as all other workers. They need a powerful united labour movement to pro tect them against . the attacks of monopoly, to defend world peace and strengthen democracy. They are entitled to their religious be liefs arid no one wants to inter fere with those rights. But. the attempts of the hier archy to impose its domination over the broad labour movement, which is overwhelmingly non- Catholic, must be resisted by all workers, including Catholics. For the Labor Party to be branded as a Catholic Party, taking its politics from the Vatican would, of course,, be fatal to it in an overwhelmingly non-Catholic country such as ours. , The labor movement is a broad mass movement embracing believers and unbelievers, whose aim is the improvement of the conditions of the working, people and their ulti mate emancipation from capitalist exploitation. " Attempts bj the Catholic clergy to divert labour from those noble aims can only bring disastrous results, to the .Roman Catholic Church itself.

TEST CRICKET. The gladiators have left the cricket field and the tumult and the shouting may now die down. Aus- tralia has won the Ashes, and, without minimising the achievement of our men In every department of the game, it is a little difficult to recognise the contests still as games The special correspondent of the Aus- tralian Press Association cables, in hi.« comments on Woodfull'.? decision Lo bat again on top of a tremendous lead, that the "Australians were un- ashamedly determined to rub salt into "England's wounds," and that "th»* 'match was conspicuously Jacking in "friendliness." The first impression of the leader who loves the ancient and Imperial game Is that this is an utterly wrong way to write about cricket. But the journalist who did so is perhaps doing a great service lo what was once íeally a sport, even in test games There Is no doubt about the false atmo.spheie of to-day. Even those who listened-in to the long hours of local wireless discourse by a rich variety of very-long-distance spectators of each ball bowled, lived in that atmosphere, and regularly breathed it m and out. ' It is unquestionably the wrong way to ¡ write about cricket; but theie is some- thing seriously wrong in the playing of cricket, too. Not improbably old-timers in ancient Rome deplored the decline ot the circuses When it came to pass that the defeated gladiator was ex- pected to pay the penalty of being slain for so offending. Cricket crowds also have come dangerously near to wanting blood. Real cricketers in England would rather Englishmen had not won the Ashes in Australia two years ago than win as tliey did with bowling tactics legitimate or not, is beside the point - which angered the crowd and estranged players. We should not be surprised to hear that many Australians would rathei their team had not won the match just ovéi-albeit the decisive contest - in the way they did. As our representative says in his cable com- ments, the Australians in playing; then second innings "were determined to .win a victory which would come, any- way, but which served their purpose .'bettei in the hollow fashion by which "it was established." They were, in the current phrase, "out to get their own back" on the Englishmen in re- venge foi the "body-line" bowling. Even housebreakers and othei police offenders, we are told, ceased their normal nocturnal pursuits in their eagerness to follow the broadcasters' story of the contest. Pi ess gibes about the Australians' alleged dislike of fast bowling, and the omission of Voce after his démonstration at Nottingham, be- cause of Australian susceptibilities, cannot have improved the frame of mind in which Woodfull made his de- cision. The winning of the toss was forecast as a decisive factor, for the match was to last to exhaustion point as far a? time was concerned, and the side -which batted first -was expected to fight for more than the Ashes. It had to prove by ordeal its argument about the playing of the game-or at least the argument of its millions of sup- porters-and to prove it by giving the other side such a drubbing as to estab- lish not so much prowess on a field of spoit as a polemic almost, involving national honour, is the once jocular | old phrase, "the ashes of cricket." , asserting itself now in mockery of I modern test exhibitions? | As we read the King's message to I the Australian captain, it ii a Royal exhortation to all concerned to put aside 8JI other feeling and look for the bright points of the game itself, j The Bradman-Ponsfoid combination in the last two matches, taken togethei has been unequalled in cricket records. Èradman has cea3ed to bp a mere | phenomenon; he Is a permanent won- der. His spirit can palpably infect the whole side, either butting or fielding. On performance in each capacity the Australian team deserved to win. They outclassed the Englishmen. Everyone is certain that the séries of dropped catches during the first Australian innings in the last test could not have happened with the Australians' fielding. The battery of Australian spin bowlers, was equal in efficiency to every call made upon It. Not was the English team, for mil its construction without Jardine. Larwood, and Voce, a side lo be reckoned lightly; theil younger men aré as impressive as out own. Theie ought to be opportunity now to let thèse oncoming players Introduce a | better spirit into the cricket of the future. It was announced last month by the M.C.C. that the new lbw rule, applicable to balls pilched on the off- side, shall be tried next season, «nd cricket-lovers will aprree that it is high time some such leform weie introduced. For one thing, it should encourage bowlers to try for the stumps again in 'assurance that the batsman will no1 b« so free to kick the ball with his pads instead of playing it with his hat. It was upon that absurdity that "aggressive leg-theory" developed.

FIFTH TEST. South Africans Score 476. LEYLAND'S 119 NOT OUT. LONDON, Aug. 19. The weather was fine and the wicket was good, when play was resumed In the fifth and final test match between England and the South Africans to-day. mhe South Africans made '16 in their first innings. England early lost three wickets, but Hammond and Layland then made a stand, the latter being 119 not out when stumps were drawn. In marked contrast to Saturday's caution, the South Africans Immediately went for runs, and were not deterred by the early fall of two wickets. Dalton played very forcefully, but made one or two risky shots. He reached 50 in an hour, and continued to drive and hook splendidly till he fell to a skied ball at cover-point. He batted for 140 minutes, and hit one five and l8 fours. Langton was equally dashing. The pair once scored 27 in 12 minutes. The innings lasted 475 minutes. The ninth wicket lasted 70 minutes, despite constant changes of bowl- ing, and keen and accurate fielding. The "Dally Telegraph" says: "Wyatt de- serves credit for making a courageous experi- ment, which failed because England's bowling was unequal to the task. It Is not the South African's fault that the game is likely to drag tediously, and have a boring conclusion. They are naturally active, and it is tragic to see them forced into defensive dullness." "The Times" says: "Wyatt is entitled to praise, as he tried at all costs to win, when a loss did not matter, and a draw would be even more futile." The "Dally Mail" describes Wyatt's deci- sion as a great spirited gamble, the kind which brings success on the battlefield. It praises Wyatt's nerve and courage, adding that there is need for more of this spirit in English cricket." "GIFT FROM HEAVEN." Sir Stanley Jackson told the representative of the "News-Chronicle" that the suggestion that Wyatt's decision had been dictated was nonsense. He may have consulted with ex- perienced players, but the ultimate decision, which required much courage, was his alone. "I think, however, that the South Africans nrist have welcomed the decision as a gift from heaven," he added. Scores: SOUTH AFRICA.-First Innings.

    MARGARINE QUOTAS Butter industry 'not threatened' Polyunsaturated mar garine did not'-'pose a threat to the butter in dustry, the NSW Min ister for Agriculture, Mr Crawford, said last night. Speaking on the eve of the Australian Agricul tural Council meeting in Canberra, Mr Crawford said, in an interview that not enough polyunsatur ated margarine was al lowed by quota to meet the demand. He said the council previously had decided there should be an in crease in quotas but had not determined the size of the increase or the way in which it should be dis tributed among the States. He said many people believed, or had been ad vised by their doctors, that they should not eat animal fats. It was wrong to prevent their buying polyunsaturated margar ines. He did not know how far the quotas could be in creased "without arousing the ire of the dairy indus try", but he did not think Mr Crawford Help Mr Crawford that polyunsaturated mar garine posed a threat. What did threaten tho dairy industry were much cheaper cooking mar garines that could be spread. These contained 909o animal fat and were not subject to quotas. The quota for produc tion of polyunsaturated margarine will be high on the agenda of the two-day council meeting. The council will be chaired for the first time by the new Minister for Primary Industry, Senator Wriedt. Other important topics will be the effects of re valuation and drought, and how the Common wealth intends to help farmers suffering because of them.

  <TD>
    Leslie Newton Penhall, born in Adelaide in 1923, was transferred to the native affairs branch in Darwin in November 1941.  He first interacted with Aboriginal people in December 1941 during a visit to Delisaville with Bill Harney, as part of the evacuation preparations following the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Penhall was impressed by the Aboriginal community's ability to live without modern conveniences.\n \nDuring the bombing of Darwin on February 19, 1942, Penhall was in the administrator's office when he heard enemy planes approaching.  He counted nine formations of five planes before running towards the post office.  Along the way, he observed the destruction of the police barracks, the tennis court, and the post office itself.  The harbor was also heavily damaged, with ships hit and oil spreading, causing a fire.\n \nPenhall and others took cover at the bottom of a cliff until the all-clear sounded.  He later learned that the A-bomb had destroyed the Bald family and some girls from the telephone exchange.  He also witnessed the destruction of the USS Peary and the sinking of the British motorist, an oil tank.  Penhall survived a second raid by taking cover behind a brick building and saw an Australian aircraft being shot down by enemy planes.  His account ends with him being evacuated after the raids.\n \nAfter the war, Penhall recounts his experiences at the Rankin River Police Station, where he faced a dilemma about removing a 15-16-year-old girl from a homestead.  The girl was employed at the station and cared for by Mrs. Barnes, who had a young child.  Penhall was initially unsure of what to do with the girl due to her age and the fact that she was being looked after.  However, he was convinced by Seb Barnes, a member of parliament and the brother of the manager, who signed a statutory declaration confirming the girl's age and well-being.

<P>
  <UL>
    <LI>In a small number of instances (about 4 in the above examples), the raw JSON values were not quoted (corrected above)</LI>
    <LI>In a small number if instances (about 8 in the above examples), double quotes within a JSON value were not escaped (corrected above).</LI>


    <LI>There are many errors in some of the OCR examples, but the entity extraction seems to work suspiciously well.  For example, the only reference to (Bill) Ponsford in article 5 is <I>"The Bradman-Ponsfoid combination in the last two matches.."</I>, yet he is extracted as an entity named "Ponsford" (correct) not "Ponsfoid" (incorrect), and even (correctly) participates in a relationship ("BATting_PARTNERSHIP" with Bradman).

    </LI>

    <LI>
      The "reason" generation is often not literal from the text.  For example, in article 9, Mrs Beck is extracted as 
      an entity with reason "mother of the groom".  The text triggering this was ".. was married to Mr. Thomas Dunning, of Darlinghurst Police Station, and son of Mrs. Beck, of Thirroul.".  Furthermore, "Thirroul" was extracted as an entity of type "Place" with the reason "residence of groom's mother".  This is impressive, but unfortunately that relationship between Mrs Beck and Thirroul was not explicitly described, but this may have been to the token limit.
    </LI>
    <LI>Execution takes a long time on long text- typically over 30 secs, due to many input and especially output tokens.  Investigate whether system prompt is being effectively cached. Investigate whether a prompt clause such as 'Select the 10 most important entities and 15 most important relationships for output.' does more harm than good.</LI>
    <LI>Simple Preference Option (SPO) used to fine-tune the Gemma2 model may or may not be beneficial to this specific task.</LI>
    <LI>What other and possibly smaller/faster models will do this better?</LI>  
    <LI>Example of a possibly too judgemental/provocative description: From the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-30/zelenskyy-suggests-ukraine-would-cede-russia-territory-for-nato/104668082">ABC news article on the Russian-Ukraine war</a>, Gemma2-9B extracts this relationship:
<PRE>
    {
        "from": {
            "type": "ORGANIZATION",
            "name": "Russia"
        },
        "to": {
            "type": "EVENT",
            "name": "Russian Drone Attacks on Ukraine"
        },
        "relationship": "PERPETRATOR",
        "reason": "Directly linked to the drone attacks described"
    }    
</PRE>
    The relationship name "Perpetrator" is not neutral, as is not a term used in the article.  "Originator", "Instigator", "Attacker" may be more neutral, whereas "Perpetrator" is taking a side (categorising the 
    attacks as a crime, a view which is not universal), and as such is probably not helpful.

  <UL>
    <LI>There was NO malformed JSON except the article with the cricket score card, which, in writing 
      more relationships and entities, Qwen ran out of output tokens (so JSON waw truncated).
    </LI>


    <LI>Like Gemma2, this model interpreted Ponsford from the OCR error - impressive but also warning-bells ring 
      (as do we <I>want</I> it to be creative?)

    </LI>


    <LI>Execution is much quicker (guessing half the time?) as Gemma2.</LI>

    <LI>Example of an incorrect relationship:  From the <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/236738769">Tribune article discussing the involvement of Catholic leaders Mannix and Gilroy in politics</a> Qwen extracts this relationship which is not based on a reasonable interpretation of the text:
<PRE>
    {
        "from": {
            "type": "ORGANISATION",
            "name": "Roman Catholic hierarchy"
        },
        "to": {
            "type": "ORGANISATION",
            "name": "DLP"
        },
        "relationship": "OPPOSES",
        "reason": "Dr. Mannix and Santa-Maria are the spiritual fathers of the semi-fascist DLP"
    },
</PRE>    
    The article is certainly partisan (the Tribune was an organ of the Communist Party), and it is difficult to
     follow some of the assertions in the article, but this relationship, stating that the Roman Catholic hierarchy "opposes" the DLP, seems if anything, the opposite of the assertions made in the article.   

    </LI>
    <LI>
        Example of an incorrect relationship: In the <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/135882126">Wedding article</a>, Qwen ascribes the object ("to") of the "BEST MAN" relationship as the bride (Jean McCloskey) rather than the more traditional groom, or possibly the wedding.

    <LI>In the same article, Qwen silently corrects the OCR error "Chnrlton Cafe" to "Charnton Cafe", which is an 
        incorrect guess (should be "Charlton Cafe").  Gemma2-9B does not attempt a correction, reporting the 
        entity as it was OCRed.

Revised system prompt:

<PRE>
Your task is to extract significant entities and their relationships from the provided text.

Entities:

Identify core entities with types such as PERSON, ORGANISATION, PLACE, EVENT, CONCEPT. For novel entity types, classify them based on semantic similarity to these core entity types or create new types as needed.

Relationships:

Identify relationships between entities. Common relationship types include: VISITED, ATTENDED, CREATED, IS_A, PART_OF, HAS_PROPERTY, OCCURS_AT, INVOLVES.

You should be flexible in identifying new relationship types as needed.

Output the results in JSON format as lists of entities and relationships.  Each entity should show the 
entity name as found in the text, the type of entity and the reason you have extracted it.  Each relationship
should show the name and type of two entities in the relationship, the name and type of the relationship, and
the reason you have extracted it which may include a snippet of text supporting the reason.

As an example, given this text:

### John Smith woke up startled. He'd only been in Burnley for 5 days visiting his sister, Fiona, but already
he was full of anticipation for the derby between Burnley Football Club and Blackburn Rovers later that day.
He wasted no time, jumped out of bed, fed his hungry looking dog, Molly, and headed down to Turf Moor, the 
home of Burnley Football Club. ###

### Abeles 'manipulating Hawke'
Ansett chief Sir Peter Abeles was
simply a ventriloquist manipulating
the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, to
further Ansett's special interests in
the pilots' dispute, according to Sen
ator Chris Puplick (Lib, NSW).
Senator Puplick told Parliament
yesterday that if Sir Peter and Mr
Hawke were both blown up in a
plane and asked to give their oc
cupations at "the pearly gates" then
it would not surprise him if Sir Peter
wrote "ventriloquist".
It seemed the dispute was more
about "Abelising" the Australian
airline industry than a question of
wages policy and economic product
ivity, he said.
"It is clear that the Government is
there simply to govern for its sec
tional mates," Senator Puplick said.
"It is not in the business of gov
erning on behalf of Australians."
He was speaking in a matter of
public importance debate on the
Government's handling of the dis
pute.
Senator Puplick said hotel and
tourist operators and other small
businesses depending on them had
not been compensated for pilots'
dispute losses but the airlines and
trade unionists had.
Bob Collins (Lab, NT) said Sena- I
tor Puplick should retire and devote I
his career to writing soap opera
scripts after his failure to add any
thing substantial to debate on the
dispute.
"Apart from 38 cliches and a lot
of bad jokes, there was nothing else
[in his contribution]," Senator Col
lins said.
The Opposition was protecting
the sectional interests of 1600 pilots
in the dispute while the Govern
ment was acting in the national in
terest.
Debate lapsed.###  (Article <a href='https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/122090045'>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/122090045</a> )

### Hawke
swipes
Caucus
By ANDREW FRASER
The nervousness of the Federal
Government was dramatically il
lustrated late last night when it
made significant concessions to
pharmacists - and the Prime Min
ister, Bob Hawke, dressed down
Caucus members who had criti
cised him earlier in the day.
A Caucus meeting was called for 9.30
last night to outline the $60 million phar
macists' package but members were sub
jected to a strong talk from Mr Hawke,
who was riled by personal criticism from
his own backbench which appeared in a
Melbourne newspaper yesterday.
The Prime Minister was still address
ing the meeting after midnight.
Mr Hawke's anger was aroused by an
article in yesterday's Melbourne Herald
in which 18 backbenchers were polled,
and several were strongly critical of Mr
Hawke's performance.
One backbencher, who remained
anonymous, said that the major problem
was that Mr Hawke and the Minister for
the Environment, Senator Graham Rich
ardson had taken over the Government's
agenda.
"Provided the Prime Minister can be
stopped from taking decisions, provided
he's stopped from running the country
and we j;et back main people who should
be running the country - I'm talking
about Keating, Dawkins, Button and
Walsh - then we will be right again," he
said.
Other backbenchers have said the
Government is "fighting on too many
fronts on once", but after accommodating
the pharmacists last night and meeting
most of the wage demands of public ser
vants the night before, the Government
now has only one occupation rallying
against it-the pilots.
Pharmacists have been attacking the
Government since their incomes were ef
fectively cut earlier this year by a decision
of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuner
ation Tribunal, but under the package
endorsed last night, they will receive most
of this money back again through a pro
fessional allowance.
The package provides for a $60 million
trust account, to be controlled by pharma
cists, from which payments will be made
to pharmacists for services such as coun
selling, and community pharmacy res
tructuring.
This will come into effect from May.
In the meantime $ 12 million will be made
available for amalgamations.
Under the package the Government
will join with pharmacists to approach
the tribunal for a 5 per cent mark-up to be
included within the recommended fee.
The Government will change the com
position of the tribunal to include a per
son who has "past practical experience in
community pharmacy".
Elements of the package were dis
cussed with representatives of the Phar
macy Guild of Australia, and the package
is essentially targeted to meeting their
objections.
Last night's announcement comes af
ter a long battle within the Government,
with most economic ministers supporting
the position of the Minister for Housing
and Aged Care, Peter Staples, who wanted
the tribunal decision to stand.
Within Cabinet, Senator Richardson,
urged that the objections of the pharma
cists be at least partially accommodated
in order to reduce the amount of electoral
damage the Government seems to be suf
fering at the moment
Government backbenchers, especially
those in marginal seats, were especially
nervous about the original decision, with
rural MPs especially being subjected to
strong pressure.
Feeling within Caucus was so strong
on Tuesday that it demanded last night's
meeting, after Cabinet had arrived at a
decision. ### (Article <a href='https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/120857238'>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/120857238</a>)

Another LONG one - 2376 words:<BR/>
Mr Hawke:
This is the text of Mr Hawke's
statement; issued yesterday:
After all the extreme assertions
and allegations levelled by Mr
Peacock, what emerged [on
Wednesday] was a statement
which:
Fails completely to substantiate
the grave personal allegations
made against me.
Is based on misrepresentation
and distortion.
Will be totally unconvincing to
the Australian people.
The record is clear. This Gov
ernment has consistently had,
and continues to have, an
absolute commitment to the fight
against organised crime.
Mr Peacock called upon the
Government to release the Cos
tigan report. I have made it clear
on a number of occasions, most
recently in the Parliament on 12
September, that the Government
is committed to the earliest pos
sible release of Mr Costigan's
forthcoming report, limited only
by Mr Costigan's own recom
mendations on confidentiality
and the need to ensure that in
vestigations are not prejudiced.
On which point we will also be
guided by those who will have
responsibilities in this regard.
The point was clearly made that
should the Parliament not be sit
ting, the Government will take
steps to permit the appropriate
public release of the report.
This Government has been
concerned to give the greatest
possible support to the Costigan
Royal commission. Early in the
life of this Government, in May,
1983, the Government signifi
cantly increased the financial and
staffing resources available to Mr
Costigan. The previous Govern
ment had provided the com
mission with a stafT of approx
imately 70 people. Under this
Government the number of
people employed by the Com
mission has risen to approx
imately 120, so allowing for the
recruitment of additional pro
fessional legal staff, intelligence
collators, and research, records
and ADP staff. New and larger
premises were provided for the
commission. What has been
done by this Government proves
the falsity of the assertion that we
have failed to support Mr Cos
tigan.
Neither'this Government nor
its predecessor intended that the
Costigan Royal commission
would continue indefinitely. This
Government reached the view
that it should seek to establish a
National Crime Authority struc
tured in a different way to a
Royal commission but able to
take over, on a continuing basis,
those of the Costigan com
mission's investigations which
bear on organised crime more
generally than just in connection
with the Federated Painters and
Dockers Union.
The National Crime Authority
will clearly not be the under
powered body described by Mr
Peacock. While it is carrying out
investigations into matters re
ferred to it by the Inter-Gov
ernmental Committee, it will be
able to exercise considerable
coercive powers. These powers
include the right to summon wit
nesses, to require the production
of documents, to make applica
tions for search warrants, to seize
material pursuant to those search
warrants and to seek judicial or
ders to have passports delivered
to it.
In addition to these con
siderable coercive powers - and
this is where the National Crime
Authority differs from the Royal
commission model - there is
also provision for the protection
of fundamental civil liberties and
for the active participation of the
States. As Special Prosecutor
Redlich noted in his annual re
port (p.48), "The National Crime
Authority Act 1984 gives genuine
emphasis to all three considera
tions. The authority has the
scopc to maintain the initiatives
developed by the Costigan Royal
commission."
Mr Peacock quotes in a mis
leading fashion from comments
made by Senator Evans on the
role of the States under the pre
vious Government's National
Crime Commission by deleting
the very significant qualification
made by Senator Evans that State
co-operation would ultimately
need to be forthcoming.

Mr Hawke, Mr Peacock and the crime debate

egations entirely without substance

From previous page.

Mr Peacock tries to claim that
matters under investigation by
Mr. Costigan cannot be trans
ferred directly to the new
National Crime Authority. In
fact, all references from the com
mission have been made avail
able to the National Crime
Authority and is presently being
examined by its members. The
authority will then make recom
mendations to the Inter-Gov
ernmental Committee about the
references it believes it should
receive from the committee.

This Government has always
recognised the need, as the pre
vious Government did, for a
transition period which would
overlap conclusion of the Cos
tigan commission and the estab
lishment of the National Crime
Authority. The Opposition's ac
tions in referring the National
Crime Authority Bill to a Senate
committee in November, 1983,
delayed the establishment of the
authority. But the Government
has always sought to co-operate
with Mr Costigan to ensure a
successful transition.

In this regard, the statement by
Mr Peacock that I did not bother
to reply to a particular letter from
Mr Costigan is blatantly and ob
viously misleading and typical of
his selective and tendentious
quoting from tabled correspon
dence. The copy of that letter
which was tabled in the Par

liament carrics a special annota
tion noting that the Special Min
ister of State, Mr Young, met
with Mr Costigan one week after
Mr Costigan's letter was re
ceived. At that meeting Mr
Young and Mr Costigan agreed
on a transition timetable. After
the meeting a statement agreed
between Mr Young and Mr Cos
tigan was released on the future
timetable of the Royal com

mission.

Mr Peacock tries to imply that
the Government has some politi
cal concern about the effects of
Mr Costigan's forthcoming re
port. The lessons of history show
that Mr Costigan's investigations
uncovered widespread illicit ac
tivity by the tax-avoiding friends
of the Liberal Party. These revel
ations were considerably embar
rassing to the Fraser Govern
ment. But this Government has
no reason to believe that the
Costigan commission's in
vestigations will reflect adversely

on it.

Mr Keating has already denied
completellly allegations that he
suggested to the Cabinet that the
Costigan commission should be
prematurely terminated. The
whole suggestion is wrong - it
is preposterous. It is in the same
category as the allegation made
in the Parliament by Mr Steele
Hall with the support of Mr
Peacock that Mr Barron, of my
staff, had attempted to have sup
pressed stories in The Age. This

totally untrue and scurrilous con*
coction of these desperate men
was destroyed by the editor of
The Age, Mr Burns.

Let me emphasise this particu
lar point. Mr Costigan's cor
respondence specifically refers to
my suggestion to him that he
should particularly concentrate
in the time available to him upon
that aspect of organised crime
involving the drugs trade. He
expressed his unqualified agree
ment for I believe he shares my
view that this is an abomination
and a threat to the stability of our
society. It is one subject in re
spect of which I have to fight to
retain my rationality when con
templating what should be done
to those who endanger the lives,
particularly of our young, by
profitting in this trade. I find it
impossible to convey the re
vulsion I feel at the allegation
that I would seek in any way to
inhibit the identification and
bringing to justice of anyone,
whatever their station in life, so

involved.

Mr Peacock also attempts to
blame me for leaked information
such as that which appeared in
The National Times last week. I
must agree with Mr Peacock that
the publication of this informa
tion was harmful and may well
prejudice investigations. But it is
Mr Peacock who has had access

to leaked information, and in
deed who has encouraged and
incited the leaking of material by
the use he has made of it, who
is in a position if he wishes, to
remind those responsible of their
obligations to protect confiden
tial information.

The surprise allegations made
by Mr Peacock about material
not having been tabled have al
ready been answered. As I said in
Parliament on September 6: "It
is the wish of the Government to
sec an effective transition from
the proceedings and processes of
the Costigan Royal commission
to the National Crime Authority.
It is clear that Mr Costigan and
the National Crime Authority
have a different view on the ade
quacy of the transition arrange
ments. While Mr Costigan ap
pears to believe that there will be
problems with the transition, the
National Crime Authority has
advised that its members 'dis
agree'unanimously with Mr Cos
tigan's assessment of the situ
ation. Clearly this is a matter
between Mr Costigan and the
National Crime Authority. I am
pleased to say that to assist the
House I will table later this day
the full correspondence from Mr
Costigan and the National Crime
Authority on this matter."

I tabled exactly what I under

took to table. Again Mr Peacock.

none Help
engaged in misrepresentations by
suggesting I had not tabled all
correspondence. I dealt with this
explicitly in the Parliament on

the 10th September when 1 said:
"On 7 September the Leader of
the Opposition read out a list
giving the dates of other cor
respondence between Mr Cos
tigan and me. As he indicated,
these letters were not included
among those tabled on Thursday.
A cursory inspection of the dates
involved would have shown that
they all dated back to at least
March, and in a number of cases
to 1983. These letters cover a
period well before the transition
commenced, and well before the
National Crime Authority had
come into existence. Indeed, the
date of the first letter mentioned
by Mr Peacock showed it was
written four days after this Gov
ernment was sworn into office. 1
at no stage indicated that I was
purporting to table related cor
respondence with Mr Costigan
extending back to the commence
ment of my Government. Nor
was this sought by the Opposi
tion prior to the tabling. But, to
make it crystal clear that this
Government has nothing to hide
in this matter, that is what I have
just done."

By our willingness to table
material we have clearly shown
we have nothing to hide.

Mr Peacock's comments on
the transition show that he fails
to recognise that the Costigan
Royal commission and the
National Crime Authority have
independent status based on stat
ute. When certain problems
emerged during the transition
period, the Government made
clear its firm wish that the transi
tion be effective and that the
necessary liaison take place for
this to occur. Discussions were
held with both Mr Justice Stew
art and Mr Costigan. But it
would have been wrong and im
proper for the Government to
seek to intervene and to purport
to issue instructions to these in
dependent bodies. For Mr
Peacock to suggest that this
should have been done shows
how little he appreciates the posi
tion and nature of either or
ganisation.

On 6 September I met with the
chairman, Mr Justice Stewart,
Mr Max Bingham, QC, and Mr
John Dwyer, QC, of the National
Crimes Authority, all of whom
command the highest possible
respect in the community. It
should be noted Mr Bingham and
Mr Dwyer were unanimously en
dorsed appointments by the Fed
eral Government, all State Gov
ernments and the Northern Ter
ritory. I asked Mr Justice Stew
art, with all his experience in
fighting organised crime, wheth
er there was any further as
sistance the Authority required
from the Government in its fight
against organised crime. He re
plied there was not. I asked Mr
Justice Stewart whether he was
confident the authority would be
effective in fighting organised
crime. He replied that he was. In
my discussions with the mem
bers of the authority I have em
phasised that the Government
expects the Authority to in
vestigate vigorously all matters
of substance concerning or
ganised crime without fear or
favour and let the cards fall as
they may. This is the policy of the
National Crimes Authority. By
his statement Mr Peacock has
impugned the integrity of its

members.

On the subject of the transi
tion, the authority has indicated
to me that it expects that among
the resources it will have avail
able to it at the termination of the
Costigan Commission will be:

The computer data base and sys

tem.

The analyses prepared by Com

mission staff. ? r £.

The material contained? iaithe

commission's reports^ -

One of the junior couns?);asyst

ing Mr Costigan. ,t "')j

The team of solicitors who have

been engaged in conducting
Mr Costigan's operations^

Accountants who have been in

volved in Mr Co$^gan's
operations. *

Analysts, collators and otherstaff

said by Mr Cosliganjo,rhave
been trained for the authority.
The authority's access-to tljese
resources is presently limine! by
Mr Costigan's proper reguire
ments for writing his report; but
once that task is completed.^nd
the authority has full use of the
transferred staff and materials
from Mr Costigan's commission
the authority is confident|that its
work will proceed satisfactorily.

. r. T

Mr Peacock makes'sorne
statements about The Agd fafjes.
The Government appointed the
Director of Public Prosecutions,
Mr Ian Temby, QC, to. inquire
into this material. It was Mr
Temby who recommended, after
he had concluded his inquiries,
that the matter be left as itls until
Mr Justice Stewart and the Sen
ate committee have completed
their relevant inquiries. Thi?; re
commendation has been
accepted by the Government. If
Mr Peacock condemns this' de
cision he condemns the recom
mendation of the Diretiof of
Public Prosecutions. 1 "

Mr Peacock's latest statement
is the action of a desperate man.
He has been unable to make any
effective criticisms of the Gov
ernment's economic policies.' He
is reduced to mud-slinking and
misrepresentation in a sordid at
tempt to get political mileage-out
of the organised crime issiie.'The
fact is that the Government's
actions in supporting the fight
against organised crime-have
been responsible and realistic
and will stand up to any-fair

inspection.

Mr Peacock has made specific,
scurrilous allegations against'me.
The virtually universal1 He&ciion
within the community has been
that he has demeaned'himself,
his ofTicc and his party. The
judgment has been that unless he
backs up his allegations with

hard and relevant facts his posi- <
tion will be irretrievable.'

This he has totally failed to do.
And this has been inevitable be
cause the allegations are entirely

without substance.

### Debate: Hawke by points
From TONY WRIGHT,
Political Correspondent,
in Sydney
The much-ballyhooed Great Debate
turned into a Great Yawn last night.
Both Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Opposi-
tion Leader Andrew Peacock gave entirely pre-
dictable statements and responses to questions
about the economy, social policy and the envi-
ronment.
The public debate over who won the event will
probably never be resolved.
However, there can be little doubt that Mr
Hawke won the political debate on substance
alone, while Mr Peacock scored on style.
Mr Peacock effectively failed to answer several
questions on health, wages policy and the envi-
ronment, and on four occasions could not think
of supplementary questions to follow up ques-
tions he had asked of Mr Hawke.
The Prime Minister kept to his position that
his Government's economic policies, though
tough, were in the nation's best interests, that his
social justice plan had the backing of all the major
welfare groups and that he had pushed through
the right environmental policies that had been
opposed at every turn by the Opposition.
He frankly admitted that his Government's
high-interest policy had been the result of under-
estimating demand, but that it was working.
On style, Mr Hawke looked awkward and
thin-voiced through much of the so-called debate,
apparently the result of trying too hard to appear
the reasonable conciliator. He clearly remem-
bered the 1984 debate with Mr Peacock, which
most commentators said Mr Peacock had won.
Mr Hawke did not use notes, unlike Mr Pea-
cock, who came armed with a large sheaf of
papers, which he said were Mr Hawke's list of
broken promises over his seven years as Prime
Minister.
On the other hand, Mr Peacock appeared gen-
erally comfortable and even cocky, referring to a
questioner at one stage as "old son" and claiming
that Mr Hawke was umy God, like a human
hiccup" on statements he had made about the
abandoned Wesley Vale newsprint mill project.
He said also that it appeared he was listening
to Max Gillies after Mr Hawke spoke about social
policy, because the Australia Mr Hawke had de-
scribed was "not the Australia we're living in".
Many political commentators considered the
televised debate a sideshow to the election cam-
paign, but both Liberal and Labor tacticians con-
sidered it crucial to the public perceptions of the
Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader in the
lead-up to the election.
Mr Hawke's aides were celebrating last night,
believing the debate would be a significant bonus
to Labor.
Mr Peacock was clearly confident he had won
the debate — he challenged Mr Hawke to another
debate after the two major parties' policy
launches, a challenge which Mr Hawke has not
taken up.
Mr Hawke has said he considers the election
the most important since 1949, and last night, Mr
Peacock agreed.
Mr Peacock said that Australia needed "a new
era, a new epoch and a new spirit", and said that a
Coalition Government would lead Australia into
this "new epoch".
Mr Hawke said the election was "a stark
choice" between his "strong, knowledgeable lead-
ership of a united team" and an Opposition "riv-
en by internal division and hatred".
Mr Peacock said that the Hawke Government
had chosen a "cruel, crude" method of control-
ling the economy by forcing up interest rates.
The result of this Government's policies was
that for the first time in the nation's history, the
next generation would inherit worse living stan-
dards than those of their parents.
What was needed was the Coalition's "coordi-
nated" policy of tight economic policy, coupled
with $2.7 billion of government savings, a freeing
of the labour market and a boost to productivity.
This would result in a drop in inflation and
"significantly" lower interest rates, though Mr
Peacock declined to repeat his prediction recently
of "a massive drop" in inflation rates.
Mr Hawke said he had been "running the
biggest business around" and for the first time in
history had made a profit — a $ 17 billion surplus
in the last three years, which he had used to wipe
out Commonwealth debt.
He had reduced tax rates by making the rich
pay where they had not before, had reduced
outlays, created jobs, increased manufactured ex
ports and had created the biggest investment
surge in the nation's history.
He promised to fund all election promises,
control wages and bring interest rates down.
Both leaders savaged the policies of the other
— Mr Peacock said Mr Hawke was offering
nothing but "more of the same", and Mr Hawke
said that Mr Peacock had a "$6 billion hole" in
his election promises and would collapse the
economy.
One problem with the debate was that it came
before the Government and the Opposition had
officially launched their election campaigns,
when several major policies will be spelled out.
This resulted in Mr Hawkc refusing to give
any details about his planned child-care policy,
and whether Labor would equal the Opposition's
proposed expenditure of $1 billion on child-care.
He would say only that he would be open to
questions on the issue when the policy was
launched.
But on the environment, Mr Peacock said a
Coalition Government would double present ex
penditure on the environment, particularly on
tackling soil degradation and salinity — and then
could not say how much this would cost.
"Take out the Government's funding and dou
ble it, old son," he said. "I haven't got the esti
mates with me."
Mr Hawke had already stated that his Govern-
ment's allocation for soil degradation and salinity
was $320 million.
The debate, in the ABC's Gore Hill studios in
Sydney, was moderated by the ABC's Paul Mur-
phy. There was no live audience — questioners
were Paul Kelly, of The Australian, Alan Ram-
say, of The Sydney Morning Herald, Laurie
Oakes, of the Nine Network, and Warwick Beu-
tler, of ABC Radio.
Mr Murphy tossed a coin to decide who would
make the opening statement, and Mr Hawke
won. He decided that Mr Peacock should make
the first statement. ### (Article: <a href='https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/131181771'>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/131181771</a>)</P>

### Hawke's air emergency
By TONY WRIGHT,
Political correspondent
The pilots' dispute was a na
tional emergency threatening
the entire Australian economy,
the Prime Minister, Bob
Hawke, said yesterday.
But he vowed not to give in to
what he called "blackmail ... by a
small, greedy, powerful group of al
ready privileged people".
Mr Hawke came out talking
tougher than ever in the face of
mounting criticism of his handling
of the affair — particularly his Cabi
net's decision to spend tens of
millions of dollars to compensate
the airlines for the cost of wages of
idle staff.
Mr Hawke said on the Nine Net
work's A Current Affair that he was
staking his credibility on defeating
the pilots.
The Leader of the Opposition,
Andrew Peacock, described the
compensation — to be paid by waiv
ing landing fees — as "a massive
pay-off of taxpayers' money" to ap
pease the ACTU.
The chairman of the Australian
Tourism Industry Association, Sir
Frank Moore, said his industry felt
betrayed and outraged that the Gov
ernment had agreed to compensate
airlines without helping the tourism
sector.
The Australian Democrats issued
a statement saying the Government
was setting a dangerous precedent,
and that if compensation was to be
paid, small businesses should be in
cluded.
The Minister for Arts, Tourism
and Territories, Clyde Holding, met
the Tourism Advisory Council in
Sydney and was told that the tour
ism industry was facing economic
ruin, with losses of$35 million a day
and 15,000 casual and permanent
staff stood down nationwide. Mr
Holding agreed to arrange a meeting
between Mr Hawke and a deputa
tion from the industry.
But Mr Hawke rejected compen
sation for the tourist industry, al
though he hinted there could be
some financial assistance after the
pilots' dispute to mount a campaign
to lure tourists back to Australia.
He said the Government was not
simply fighting an isolated industrial
dispute — it was fighting to protect
the whole Australian economy, and
all Australians would benefit when
the fight was won.
The pilots' 30 per cent wage
claim, if succcssful, would result in a
debilitating wage explosion, fol
lowed by out-of-control inflation
and unemployment out of control.
Company profits and investment
would be destroyed by higher inter
est rates.
"There can be no doubt that, sub
stantial as they are, the costs of re
I 1
sisting the [Australian Federation of
Air Pilots'] demands pale into insig
nificance beside the absolutely unac
ceptable costs of giving in to them,"
Mr Hawke said.
In defence of his Government's
stance, he outlined a series of mea
sures that he predicted would result
in the airlines being able to meet 25
per cent of their normal carrying
capacity by next week and half their
capacity by the end of the month.
He said that Ansett and Austra
lian Airlines would be able to return
to fiill carrying capacity "in time"
even if the "worst case" occurred
and the large majority of pilots who
had quit did not sign new contracts
with the airlines. But he announced
a "significant breakthrough" — he
said some senior group captains had
signed new contracts yesterday.
The Opposition spokesman on
tourism, aviation and sport, David
Jull, said Mr Hawke's statement was
waffle — even if the airlines got back
to 50 per cent capacity by the end of
the month "it gives no hope to tour
ism to really survive the battering it
has been getting over the last
month".
Ansett and Australian managed
to get one plane each into the air
yesterday, in what was clearly a sym
bolic gesture, rather than any signifi
cant departure from the paralysis
that has struck the airlines over the
past month.
Spokesmen for both airlines said
the planes were crewed by their own
pilots, but they did not explain if
they were management pilots or fed

An Australian Airlines Boeing
727 left Melbourne with 122 passen
gers, flying to Sydney and Brisbane
and then returning to Melbourne
last night.
An Ansett 737-300 carried 114
passengers to Sydney and was re
turned to Melbourne in the after
noon.
They were the first two flights by
the national carriers since they shut
down operations on August 24 after
several days of flying between 9am
and 5pm.
Mr Hawke announced yesterday
that he had established a ministerial
committee, chaired by the Minister
for Transport and Communications,
Ralph Willis, to "supervise the Gov
ernment response [to the dispute]
and oversight longer-term contin
gency planning".

Hawke's air emergency

Continued from Page 1

The committee will include the Minister for
Industrial Relations, Peter Morris, and. the
Minister for Defence, Kim Beazley.

Another committee of senior departmental
officials, chaired by the secretary of the
Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet,
Mike Cqdd, has been established to support the

ministerial committee.

The two Ansett and Australian Airlines planes
that took to the air yesterday, combined with the
Royal Australian Air Force and international
flights to provide about 5500 scats: about 20 per
cent of normal Australian-wide demand.

Next week, two American-West- planes will
become available to Ansett, taking capacity to 25
per cent of demand.

"Over the subsequent fortnight, additional air
craft, including many leased from overseas, will
come into operation on' domestic routes," Mr

Hawke said.

"These include six new leases arranged in the
last 48 hours from the UK and Europe.

"By the end of the month, sufficient capacity to
meet 50 per cent of normal demand will be
available—15,900 seats."

Mr Hawke said the two major airlines would
be able to boost training of new pilots by allowing
them to upgrade their qualifications to meet Civil
Aviation Authority standards.

He expected the pace to quicken with
federation pilots breaking ranks and signing new
contracts. But even if this did not happen, he
believed there would be sufficient pilots applying
to the major airlines from smaller airlines .and

from overseas to meet the demand.

Reacting to questions and criticism about the
airlines receiving compensation, Mr Hawke said
that the airlines themselves "are not getting one
cent of taxpayers' money" that the tourist indus
try could feel entitled to.

The money was to keep workers on standby
who otherwise would be stood down.. These
workers had to be kept on so the airlines would be
ready to fly, Mr Hawke said.

"I wish to make it absolutely clear that my
Government is not compensating the airlines for
other losses or for revenues or profits lost as a
result of the pilots' actions."

• "The airlines' losses are running around $20
million per week before, considering the wages of
those normally stood down. They are bearing
these costs themselves in the belief that they
cannot afford the demands of the greedy AFAP."

The precise cost of the compensation has not
yet been worked out. Each airline's normal wage
bill is around $7 million a week, but many work

ers have taken leave and therefore will not be
counted in the compensation-deal;- Mr Hawke

said. ### (Article <a href='https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/120852381'>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/120852381</a>)</P>

(BY OUR SPEC?IL REPORTER.)
The Hen. Alfred Deakin, ex-Prime
Miinister of the Commonwealth, and
now leader of what he has himself'
described as "the centre party" in the'
Federal Parliament, spent a most in
tertestinp time yesterday in the Lock
yer district, a section of the consti
tuency represented by the Ron. L. E.
Groom. In the course of hIis hurried
run throuch the district he addressed
public meetinos at Gatton and Laid
lec, was accorded public receptions at
both pilacqs, and also paid a brief
visit to the Queensland Agricultural
College.
RECEPTION AT GATTON.
Mr. Deakin, aoccompanied by Mr.
Groom, arrived at Gatton from
Toowoomba by the 9.20 a.m. train.
On alighting he was met'by Crs.
C. Gunne, W. L. l)art, J. Skinner,
and N. J. W. Neilsen, of the Taramps
lShire Council, tile clerk of the coun
cil (Mr. J. T. Young), and lessrs. R.
James (Chairman of thle local Pro
gress Association), J. Coleman, B.
Bloom, I. England, and F. Lindf
mayer. An adjpurnment was made
to Fr. Wagner's Commercial Hotel,
where Hr. DBeakln was formailly wel
comned. •
Cr. Gunne proposed the health of
the .IHon. A. Deakin, and, in doina
so, apologised for the absence,
thloughi indisposition, of the Chair.
man of the council (Cr. T. O'Brien).
On behalf of the council he accorded
Mr. Deakin a cordial welcome, and
expressed a hope that, in a political
sense, ldi visit to the distrioc and
to Queensland would bear good fruit.
(Appllause.)
Cr. Neilsen emphasised thu welcome
tendered by Cr. Gunne, and said the
people were looking to Mr. Dcakin
to see what hlie was gohing to do.for
them. The present was an excoeding
ly anxious time for those who took
an interest in politics and who advo
ceted a two-party system. (Applause.)
Thei trouble latelh hlad been that the
people were getting more legislation
than was good for them, and, if
things continued as they had been
goine, there was a danger of themn
all becoming civil servants. (Laugh
ter.)
Mr. Deakin: Most people would likes
to be. (Laughter.)
Mr. Neilsen: Yes, but many of us
cannot bIe. (Lauohtcr.l
Ir. R. Jaines, in endorsing the
words of welcome expressed bIy prw
'ious speakers. said they were look
ing to Mr. Dealcin and his policy
to see if they could lift the country
out of the mire into which it had
got. The three-party system was a
"reat drawlnackl to the Common
wealtli, and the country was being
hamplered by legislation passed in the
interests of one class only. "Logisla
tion," hle said, "must be adopted to
suit eoe\ry class in the community.
enid they believed Mr. Deakin would
endeavour to do so." (Applause.)
M?. Deakiie. in resplonding, expressed
his lthanks for the cordiality of the
.eelcomce which had '.been accorded
dim. 'J'ouchiueg on the allusions to
the vexations political position ac

Parliament ? - If they would bring to
mind the experience of attempts of the
sort be had referred to hey wouli
realise that little good resulted, be
cause the people--the masters of the
politicians-were not sufficiently unaun
mous to give Parliament a majorlity
on a two-party system. A great manay
if the electors did not even trouble
to express themselves at the ballot
box. They could not have a dominant
party without a dominant vote. H
had ~een making persistent efforts to
wards that end for a long time past,
tnd hejwould continue to do so, but
as fast as one made an attempt to as
soeiate with another section, he would
tind that some of those hitherto .as
eociatgd with him moved off with ap
prehension. There was not that ad
fiesion which 'iharacterised the Labour
Piarty, and which, in that party, was
obtained by restraints to which many
politicians olieoted. ,In his subsequent
remarks he observed that fram what
he had said they would see that the
difliculties in the way of bringing
about a two-party system were not
made by the politicians.
Cr. Neilsen: We look to politicians
t6 be a brake on the coach so that
experimental legislation will note inbjle
the country.
Mr. Deakin observed that in a p·
litically free-thinking community lihe
theirs the task of the Federal politi
can was not to be envied. They must*
realise that until the people of Aus
tralia took a deeper interest in poli
tics and returned to Parliament a ma
jority of members to support a po
licy, it was diflicult to see how the
change could be brought about. He
could not see that the remedy was in
the haneds of t.e politicians. If the
latter were sent to Parliament with
indefinite instructions what were they
to do?
The proceedings then terminated. ###
